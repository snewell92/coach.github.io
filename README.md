# Coaching by Sean

This is a project I set up to handle inbound coaching / mentoring / tutoring / leveling-up sessions
at my hourly rate over zoom or in person in Edinburgh.

If you want to get in touch directly, just email me at <a href="mailto:sean@thenewells.us">sean@thenewells.us</a>.

## Development

<details>

<summary>How to develop locally</summary>

If you wanna fork this for your own purposes, or make a PR, you will first need to get:

- NodeJS (recommended v18+)
- pnpm (`brew install pnpm` or equivalent)
- An adequate editor with Typescript support (Neovim / VSCode)

Once your have that software installed, `git clone ...` this repo and then run `pnpm install`.

You're all set to run `pnpm dev` to get going locally!

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components go.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
