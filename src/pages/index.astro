      <h1 class="text-4xl">Sailing the Dev Seas</h1>
      <p class="mt-2">Software Engineering can feel like being on the open sea. When you have a course charted, it can be an invigorating and life giving adventure akin to setting sail. But if your star chart is off, the compass is broken, your sail fails, or the rudder is busted - it is easy to start drifting off course. Great managers help a ton, good tech friends or commnity can upgrade your kit, but sometimes you don't have those resources at your disposal. I can be that resource for your journey.</p>
